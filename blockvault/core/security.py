"""Simplified security utilities (on-chain RBAC removed).

Previously the system attached dynamic roles (viewer/owner/admin) resolved via
an on-chain RoleRegistry contract. All that logic has been removed for the
offâ€‘chain edition. For now, every authenticated address is implicitly treated
as an OWNER for file operations; selective sharing still governs access to
non-owned files via explicit share records.

If you later reintroduce granular roles, add a lightweight role resolver and
decorate endpoints accordingly.
